Whether you're safeguarding sensitive data in images or anonymizing individuals in video streams, YOLO11's object detection capabilities make it easier to identify and blur selected objects with precision. This feature is particularly useful in industries like surveillance, media, and compliance where data privacy is paramount.

By leveraging YOLO11's segmentation and detection capabilities, users can isolate specific objects and apply blurring as needed. This ensures compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR while maintaining the context of images and videos.

To learn more about YOLO11â€™s solutions, visit the [Ultralytics YOLO Guides](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/) for comprehensive tutorials or explore its practical applications in privacy management.

### Example Python Code

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load YOLO11 model
model = YOLO("yolo11-model.pt")

# Perform object detection and apply blur
results = model.predict(source="input_video.mp4", save=True, conf=0.5)

# Save output with blurred objects
results.save_blurred("output_video.mp4")
```
