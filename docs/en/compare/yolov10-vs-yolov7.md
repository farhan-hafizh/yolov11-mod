## YOLO11 Functionalities: Object Tracking

Object tracking is a powerful functionality of Ultralytics YOLO11, enabling users to monitor and follow objects across multiple video frames. This feature is crucial for applications such as surveillance, sports analytics, and traffic monitoring, where real-time tracking is necessary. By combining object detection with tracking algorithms, YOLO11 provides seamless performance even in dynamic environments.

To get started with object tracking, you can utilize the Ultralytics Python package. This allows for easy integration into various workflows and customization based on specific project needs. For more details and a comprehensive guide on tracking, explore the [Ultralytics documentation on tracking](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/).

### Python Code Example for Object Tracking

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a YOLO11 model pre-trained on COCO8 dataset
model = YOLO("yolo11.pt")

# Run object tracking on a video file
results = model.track(source="video.mp4", save=True, show=True)

# Display tracking results
print(results)
```

With YOLO11â€™s advanced tracking capabilities, you can achieve precise results tailored to your real-world applications. Learn more about YOLO11's functionalities in the [Ultralytics guides](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/).
