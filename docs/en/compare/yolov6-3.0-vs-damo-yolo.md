## Using the Predict Functionality in Ultralytics YOLO11

Ultralytics YOLO11 excels at making real-time predictions across various computer vision tasks, such as object detection, segmentation, and classification. The **predict** functionality allows you to feed images or videos into the model and receive actionable insights through bounding boxes, masks, or keypoints.

This feature is particularly useful in applications like surveillance, wildlife monitoring, and retail analytics. With YOLO11, you can ensure high accuracy and speed for your prediction tasks. The process is straightforward, and you can leverage pre-trained models or fine-tune them for your specific dataset.

For more details on how to use YOLO11 for predictions, refer to the [Ultralytics YOLO documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/).

### Python Code Snippet for Predictions

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a pre-trained YOLO11 model
model = YOLO("yolo11.pt")

# Perform predictions on an image
results = model.predict(source="image.jpg", save=True)

# Display results
results.show()
```

This snippet demonstrates how to load a model, perform predictions, and visualize the results.
