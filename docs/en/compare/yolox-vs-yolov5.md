## Predict Functionality in Ultralytics YOLO11

The Predict functionality in Ultralytics YOLO11 enables users to perform real-time inference across a wide range of computer vision tasks. Whether youâ€™re working on object detection, segmentation, or classification, this feature ensures efficient and precise predictions. YOLO11 offers seamless integration with pre-trained models and custom datasets, making it versatile for diverse applications like retail analytics, wildlife monitoring, and industrial inspection.

To get started with predictions, you can load the model, input your image or video, and retrieve results with bounding boxes, masks, or class labels. For more details, explore the [Ultralytics YOLO11 documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/).

### Example Python Code for Predict Functionality

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a pre-trained YOLO11 model
model = YOLO("yolo11.pt")

# Perform prediction on an image
results = model.predict(source="image.jpg", save=True)

# Display results
results.show()
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to make predictions on an image using YOLO11, with options to save and visualize the output.
