## YOLO11 Functionalities: Predict

<<<<<<< HEAD
The Predict functionality in Ultralytics YOLO11 enables users to perform inference on images, videos, and streams with remarkable accuracy and speed. This feature is designed for real-time applications, providing instant insights across various domains like object detection, image classification, and segmentation. With YOLO11's Predict mode, users can leverage pre-trained models or fine-tune their own for specific tasks.
=======
Ultralytics YOLO11 provides exceptional flexibility for fine-tuning models on specific datasets like the **Car Parts Segmentation Dataset**. This capability enables users to adapt YOLO11 to highly specialized use cases, such as identifying and categorizing individual car components. Leveraging datasets like [Roboflow's Car Parts Segmentation dataset](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/segment/carparts-seg/) ensures that the model delivers precise segmentation results tailored to automotive applications.

To get started with Predictions using YOLO11, you can use the Ultralytics Python package. Here's an example:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a pre-trained YOLO11 model
model = YOLO("yolo11.pt")

# Run predictions on an image
results = model.predict(source="image.jpg", conf=0.25)

# Display results
results.show()
```

For more details on using the Predict feature, explore the [official documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/predict/). Additionally, learn about other capabilities like exporting models in different formats or tracking objects in real time on the [Ultralytics Guides page](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/).
