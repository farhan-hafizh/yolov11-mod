## YOLO Performance Metrics

Understanding performance metrics is essential for evaluating and improving the efficiency of your Ultralytics YOLO11 models. Metrics like mean Average Precision (mAP), Intersection over Union (IoU), and F1 score provide critical insights into model accuracy, precision, and recall. These metrics help you measure how well your model detects and classifies objects in real-world scenarios.

For instance, mAP is widely used to assess object detection models and is calculated by averaging the precision across different recall levels. Meanwhile, IoU measures the overlap between the predicted and actual bounding boxes, making it a key metric for localization tasks.
