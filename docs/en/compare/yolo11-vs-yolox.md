## Object Blurring: Enhancing Privacy in Vision AI

Object blurring is a critical solution offered by Ultralytics YOLO11 to enhance privacy in computer vision applications. This functionality allows users to obscure specific objects or areas within images or videos, making it invaluable for scenarios where sensitive information, such as faces, license plates, or confidential data, needs to be concealed. 

By integrating object detection with precise blurring techniques, YOLO11 ensures that privacy compliance is maintained without compromising the overall utility of the visual data. This feature is particularly useful in industries like security, retail, and healthcare, where protecting identity and sensitive details is paramount.
