## Fine-Tuning on the African Wildlife Dataset

Ultralytics YOLO11 allows for seamless fine-tuning on specialized datasets, such as the **African Wildlife Dataset**, to enhance detection capabilities for specific use cases. This dataset is tailored for recognizing and classifying animals in their natural habitats, making it ideal for applications in wildlife conservation, research, and eco-tourism. By leveraging YOLO11's advanced features, users can achieve higher accuracy and adaptability in detecting diverse species.

Fine-tuning YOLO11 on the African Wildlife Dataset is straightforward. The process involves using pre-trained weights and retraining the model with your dataset. This ensures the model adapts effectively to unique environments and object classes present in wildlife scenarios.

For more details on custom dataset usage and fine-tuning techniques, explore [Ultralytics YOLO11 tutorials](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/).

### Python Code Example

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load the pre-trained YOLO11 model
model = YOLO('yolov11n.pt')

# Fine-tune on the African Wildlife Dataset
model.train(data='african_wildlife.yaml', epochs=50, imgsz=640)

# Validate the fine-tuned model
metrics = model.val()

# Save the fine-tuned model
model.save('yolov11_african_wildlife.pt')
``` 

This code demonstrates how to fine-tune YOLO11 on the African Wildlife Dataset for optimized performance.
