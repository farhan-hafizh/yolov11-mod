## Utilizing YOLO11 for Predict Functionality

The **Predict** functionality in Ultralytics YOLO11 is a cornerstone for real-time inference and object detection. It allows users to feed in images, videos, or streams, and receive precise predictions for various tasks such as object detection, segmentation, and classification. With its intuitive framework, YOLO11 simplifies prediction workflows, enabling seamless integration into different applications like surveillance, retail analytics, and more.

For a step-by-step guide on using the predict function, explore the [Ultralytics YOLO11 Documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/).

### Python Code Example

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load model
model = YOLO("yolov11.pt")

# Perform prediction on an image
results = model.predict(source="image.jpg", show=True)

# Display results
results.show()
```

This compact approach ensures efficiency and accuracy, empowering users to harness YOLO11's capabilities with ease.
