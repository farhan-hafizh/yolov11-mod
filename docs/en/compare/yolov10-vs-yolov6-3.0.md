### Python Code Example for Tracking

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a pre-trained YOLO11 model
model = YOLO('yolo11n.pt')

# Perform object tracking on a video
results = model.track(source='video.mp4', save=True, show=True)

# Display tracking results
for frame in results:
    print(frame.boxes)  # Print detected boxes for each frame
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to apply YOLO11 for object tracking on video data.
