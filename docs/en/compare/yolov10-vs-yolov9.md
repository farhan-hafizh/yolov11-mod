## YOLO Performance Metrics

Understanding performance metrics is critical for evaluating and optimizing Ultralytics YOLO11 models. Metrics such as Mean Average Precision (mAP), Intersection over Union (IoU), and F1 Score provide insights into a model's detection accuracy and efficiency. These metrics help developers ensure their models perform optimally across diverse datasets and real-world scenarios.

For example, mAP is widely used to measure the precision and recall across different confidence thresholds, indicating how well the model detects and classifies objects. IoU calculates the overlap between predicted and ground-truth bounding boxes, while the F1 Score balances precision and recall to offer a single performance measure.
