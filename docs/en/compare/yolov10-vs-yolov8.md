## YOLO Performance Metrics

Understanding performance metrics is essential for evaluating and optimizing your Ultralytics YOLO11 models. Key metrics such as mean Average Precision ([mAP](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/accuracy)), Intersection over Union (IoU), and [F1 score](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/f1-score) provide valuable insights into model accuracy and efficiency. These metrics enable developers to fine-tune their models for real-world applications.

For instance, mAP evaluates the precision-recall tradeoff, offering a comprehensive view of model performance. IoU measures the overlap between predicted and actual bounding boxes, while the F1 score balances precision and recall for a unified metric. By regularly benchmarking your YOLO11 models using these indicators, you can ensure optimal performance in tasks like object detection, segmentation, and classification.
