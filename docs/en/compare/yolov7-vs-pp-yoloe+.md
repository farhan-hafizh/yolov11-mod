## Fine-Tuning on Car Parts Segmentation Dataset  

Ultralytics YOLO11 offers exceptional flexibility for fine-tuning on specific datasets, such as the Car Parts Segmentation dataset. This functionality is particularly valuable for industries like automotive manufacturing and e-commerce, where precise object segmentation is crucial for inventory management, repair workflows, or creating detailed product catalogs. The Car Parts Segmentation dataset allows YOLO11 to identify and categorize individual vehicle components accurately.  

Fine-tuning leverages pre-trained YOLO11 weights on the COCO dataset, adapting the model to new datasets and improving performance for specialized tasks. This process ensures higher accuracy and relevance for specific use cases. For a detailed guide on using YOLO11 for Car Parts Segmentation, visit the [Ultralytics documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/segment/carparts-seg/).  

### Example: Custom Training YOLO11 on Car Parts Segmentation  

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a pre-trained YOLO11 model
model = YOLO('yolo11.pt')

# Train the model on the car parts segmentation dataset
model.train(data='carparts.yaml', epochs=50, imgsz=640)

# Validate the model
metrics = model.val()
print(metrics)
```
