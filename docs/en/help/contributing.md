### Google-Style Docstrings

When adding new functions or classes, please include [Google-style docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html). These docstrings provide clear, standardized documentation that helps other developers understand and maintain your code.

!!! example "Example Docstrings"

    === "Google-style"

         This example illustrates a Google-style docstring. Ensure that both input and output `types` are always enclosed in parentheses, e.g., `(bool)`.

         ```python
         def example_function(arg1, arg2=4):
             """
             Example function demonstrating Google-style docstrings.

             Args:
                 arg1 (int): The first argument.
                 arg2 (int): The second argument, with a default value of 4.

             Returns:
                 (bool): True if successful, False otherwise.

             Examples:
                 >>> result = example_function(1, 2)  # returns False
             """
             if arg1 == arg2:
                 return True
             return False
         ```

    === "Google-style with type hints"

         This example includes both a Google-style docstring and type hints for arguments and returns, though using either independently is also acceptable.

         ```python
         def example_function(arg1: int, arg2: int = 4) -> bool:
             """
             Example function demonstrating Google-style docstrings.

             Args:
                 arg1: The first argument.
                 arg2: The second argument, with a default value of 4.

             Returns:
                 True if successful, False otherwise.

             Examples:
                 >>> result = example_function(1, 2)  # returns False
             """
             if arg1 == arg2:
                 return True
             return False
         ```

    === "Single-line"

         For smaller or simpler functions, a single-line docstring may be sufficient. The docstring must use three double-quotes, be a complete sentence, start with a capital letter, and end with a period.

         ```python
         def example_small_function(arg1: int, arg2: int = 4) -> bool:
             """Example function with a single-line docstring."""
             return arg1 == arg2
         ```

### GitHub Actions CI Tests

All pull requests must pass the GitHub Actions [Continuous Integration](https://docs.ultralytics.com/help/CI/) (CI) tests before they can be merged. These tests include linting, unit tests, and other checks to ensure that your changes meet the project's quality standards. Review the CI output and address any issues that arise.

## Reporting Bugs

We highly value bug reports as they help us maintain the quality of our projects. When reporting a bug, please provide a [Minimum Reproducible Example](https://docs.ultralytics.com/help/minimum_reproducible_example/)â€”a simple, clear code example that consistently reproduces the issue. This allows us to quickly identify and resolve the problem.

## License

Ultralytics uses the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/LICENSE) for its repositories. This license promotes openness, transparency, and collaborative improvement in software development. It ensures that all users have the freedom to use, modify, and share the software, fostering a strong community of collaboration and innovation.

We encourage all contributors to familiarize themselves with the terms of the AGPL-3.0 license to contribute effectively and ethically to the Ultralytics open-source community.

## Open-Sourcing Your Projects with YOLO and AGPL-3.0 Compliance

If you're considering building on YOLO models and releasing your work as open-source, it's essential to comply with the terms of the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html). This section provides a checklist, steps, and best practices to ensure your project adheres to AGPL-3.0 requirements.

### Options for Starting Your Project

You can kick-start your project using one of these approaches:

1. **Fork the Ultralytics YOLO Repository**  
   Fork the official Ultralytics YOLO repository directly from [https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics).

    - Use this option if you plan to build directly on the latest YOLO implementation.
    - Modify the forked code as needed while ensuring compliance with AGPL-3.0.

2. **Start from the Ultralytics Template Repository**  
   Use the Ultralytics template repository available at [https://github.com/ultralytics/template](https://github.com/ultralytics/template).
    - Ideal for starting a clean, modular project with pre-configured best practices.
    - This option provides a lightweight starting point for projects that integrate or extend YOLO models.

### Checklist for AGPL-3.0 Compliance

1. **License Consistency**:

    - Your project must also be licensed under AGPL-3.0.
    - Include a `LICENSE` file with the AGPL-3.0 text in your repository.

2. **Source Code Availability**:

    - Provide access to the full source code of your project, including all modifications and derivative works of YOLO models.
    - If your project includes a web application, ensure users can access the source code of the server-side components.

3. **Prominent Notices**:

    - Clearly state that your project is licensed under AGPL-3.0.
    - Attribute Ultralytics YOLO in your README or project documentation.

4. **Modification and Distribution**:

    - Inform users that they can modify and distribute your project under the same license terms.

5. **Compliance with Dependencies**:
    - Ensure any third-party dependencies are compatible with AGPL-3.0.

### Steps to Open-Source Your Project

1. **Choose AGPL-3.0 as Your License**:

    - Add a `LICENSE` file to your repository with the AGPL-3.0 license text. You can copy this text from [here](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.txt).

2. **Acknowledge Upstream Contributions**:

    - In your README file, credit Ultralytics YOLO and link to its repository. For example:
        ```
        This project builds on [Ultralytics YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics), licensed under AGPL-3.0.
        ```

3. **Provide Complete Source Code**:

    - Upload all source code to a public repository (e.g., GitHub or GitLab).
    - Include any configuration files, scripts, or dependencies required to run the project.

4. **Enable Issue Tracking and Contributions**:

    - Set up an issue tracker for bug reports and feature requests.
    - Provide guidelines for external contributions, including pull requests and coding standards.

5. **Inform Users About License Obligations**:
    - In your documentation, explain AGPL-3.0 and how it applies to your project.
    - Encourage users to respect the terms of the license when using or modifying your project.

### Best Practices for AGPL-3.0 Projects

- **Transparency**: Keep your code and documentation up-to-date. Clearly outline how to build, use, and modify your project.
- **Community Engagement**: Foster an open-source community around your project by encouraging contributions and providing prompt feedback.
- **Testing**: Implement continuous integration (CI) to ensure your code remains reliable and contributions don't break functionality.
- **Security**: Regularly review your codebase for vulnerabilities and ensure sensitive data (e.g., API keys) is not included in your repository.

### Example Repository Structure

Below is an example structure for a compliant AGPL-3.0 project:

```
my-yolo-project/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE               # AGPL-3.0 license text
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md             # Project overview and license information
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                  # Source code for the project
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ model.py          # YOLO-based model implementation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils.py          # Utility scripts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml        # Python dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                # Unit and integration tests
â”œâ”€â”€ .github/              # GitHub Actions for CI
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ workflows/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ ci.yml        # Continuous integration configuration
â””â”€â”€ docs/                 # Project documentation
    â””â”€â”€ index.md
```

By following this guide, you can ensure your project remains compliant with AGPL-3.0 while contributing to the open-source community. Your adherence strengthens the ethos of collaboration, transparency, and accessibility that drives the success of projects like YOLO.
