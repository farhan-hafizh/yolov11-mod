## Fine-Tuning YOLO11 on the African Wildlife Dataset

Ultralytics YOLO11 allows seamless fine-tuning on diverse datasets, including the **African Wildlife Dataset**, enabling the model to recognize and detect species-specific features in wildlife monitoring applications. This capability is particularly useful for conservation efforts, where precise identification of animals like lions, elephants, and zebras can aid in population tracking and habitat monitoring.

By leveraging YOLO11's advanced training modes, you can achieve exceptional accuracy tailored to the nuances of the African Wildlife Dataset. For more insights on custom training, check the [documentation here](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/train/).

### Python Code Example: Fine-Tuning YOLO11

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load YOLO11 model
model = YOLO("yolo11.pt")

# Train the model on the African Wildlife Dataset
model.train(data="african_wildlife.yaml", epochs=50, imgsz=640)

# Validate the model
metrics = model.val()

# Save the fine-tuned model
model.export(format="onnx")
```
