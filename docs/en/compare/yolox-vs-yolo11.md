## YOLO11 Functionalities: Predict

The **Predict** functionality in Ultralytics YOLO11 enables users to perform accurate and efficient inference tasks on images, videos, and streams. With its cutting-edge architecture, YOLO11 excels in real-time prediction, making it ideal for applications such as surveillance, autonomous driving, and retail analytics.

To get started with predictions, you can use the Ultralytics Python package, which simplifies the process with a few lines of code. Here's an example:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load the YOLO11 model
model = YOLO("yolo11.pt")

# Predict on an image
results = model.predict(source="image.jpg", save=True)  # Replace 'image.jpg' with your image path
```

The results include bounding boxes, confidence scores, and class labels, which can be visualized or exported for further analysis.
