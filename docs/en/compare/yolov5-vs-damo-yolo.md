## YOLO Thread-Safe Inference

Ultralytics YOLO11 introduces thread-safe inference, a key functionality that ensures consistent and reliable predictions in multi-threaded environments. Thread safety is crucial when deploying models in applications where multiple processes access the model simultaneously, such as in real-time video analytics or multi-user systems.

Using thread-safe inference helps prevent race conditions and ensures the integrity of predictions across threads. For best practices, you can leverage optimized libraries and frameworks like PyTorch, which YOLO11 is built upon. This makes it easier to achieve consistent results while maintaining high performance.
