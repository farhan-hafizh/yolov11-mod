## YOLO Performance Metrics

Understanding the key metrics used to evaluate Ultralytics YOLO11 models is crucial for optimizing their performance in real-world applications. Metrics like mAP (mean Average Precision), IoU (Intersection over Union), and F1 Score provide insights into a model's detection accuracy and reliability.

mAP is widely used in object detection to assess a model's precision and recall across different confidence thresholds. IoU measures the overlap between the predicted bounding boxes and ground truth boxes, while the F1 Score balances precision and recall to give a comprehensive view of performance.
