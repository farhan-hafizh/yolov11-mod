## YOLO Performance Metrics

Understanding performance metrics is crucial when evaluating the effectiveness of Ultralytics YOLO11 models. Key metrics like mAP (mean Average Precision), IoU (Intersection over Union), and F1 Score offer insights into model accuracy and reliability. These metrics assess how well your model detects objects, segments regions, or performs classification tasks.

For practical implementation, mAP is often used in object detection to summarize the precision-recall curve, while IoU measures the overlap between predicted and ground truth bounding boxes. The F1 Score balances precision and recall, ensuring a comprehensive view of model performance.
