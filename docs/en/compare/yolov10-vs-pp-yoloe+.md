## YOLO11 Functionalities: Predict  

The predict functionality of Ultralytics YOLO11 allows users to leverage its advanced real-time inference capabilities for a wide range of applications. This feature supports object detection, segmentation, classification, and pose estimation tasks with accuracy and speed. Whether you're working with single images, videos, or live streams, the predict mode ensures seamless and efficient processing. 

For detailed instructions on using the predict functionality, check out the [Ultralytics documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/predict/). Additionally, you can explore the [Ultralytics HUB](https://www.ultralytics.com/hub) for a no-code approach to running predictions, making it accessible for both beginners and experts.  

### Example Code Snippet for Predict  
```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a pre-trained YOLO11 model
model = YOLO('yolo11.pt')

# Run prediction on an image
results = model.predict(source='image.jpg', show=True)

# Display results
results.show()
```

Leverage this functionality to analyze images efficiently and bring real-time insights to your projects.
