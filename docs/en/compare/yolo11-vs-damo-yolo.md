### Python Code Example

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a pretrained YOLO11 model
model = YOLO("yolo11.pt")

# Train the model on the African Wildlife dataset
model.train(data="african_wildlife.yaml", epochs=50, imgsz=640, batch=16)

# Validate the model
metrics = model.val()

# Save the fine-tuned model
model.save("yolo11_african_wildlife.pt")
```
