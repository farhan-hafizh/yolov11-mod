# COCO8-Multispectral Dataset

## Introduction

The [Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com/) COCO8-Multispectral dataset is an advanced variant of the original COCO8 dataset, designed to facilitate experimentation with multispectral object detection models. It consists of the same 8 images from the COCO train 2017 set—4 for training and 4 for validation—but with each image transformed into a 10-channel multispectral format. This transformation enables the development and testing of models that can leverage spectral information beyond the standard RGB channels.

COCO8-Multispectral is fully compatible with [Ultralytics HUB](https://hub.ultralytics.com/) and [YOLO11](../yolo11.md), allowing seamless integration into your computer vision workflows.

## Dataset Generation

The multispectral images in the COCO8-Multispectral dataset were generated by interpolating the standard RGB images across 10 evenly spaced spectral channels within the visible spectrum. This process involved the following steps:

1. **Wavelength Assignment**: Assign nominal wavelengths to the RGB channels—Red: 650 nm, Green: 510 nm, Blue: 475 nm.

2. **Interpolation**: Use linear interpolation to estimate pixel values at intermediate wavelengths between 450 nm and 700 nm, creating a total of 10 spectral channels.

3. **Extrapolation**: Apply extrapolation using SciPy's `interp1d` function to estimate values beyond the original RGB wavelengths, ensuring a complete spectral representation.

This method simulates a multispectral imaging process, providing a richer set of data for models to learn from. For more information on multispectral imaging techniques, refer to the [Multispectral Imaging Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multispectral_imaging).

## Dataset YAML

The COCO8-Multispectral dataset configuration is defined in a YAML file, specifying dataset paths, class names, and other essential metadata. You can review the official `coco8-multispectral.yaml` file in the [Ultralytics GitHub repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/ultralytics/cfg/datasets/coco8-multispectral.yaml).

## Usage

To train a YOLO11n model on the COCO8-Multispectral dataset for 100 [epochs](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/epoch) with an image size of 640, use the following examples. For a full list of training options, see the [YOLO Training documentation](../../modes/train.md).

!!! example "Train Example"

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a pretrained YOLO11n model
        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

        # Train the model on COCO8-Multispectral
        results = model.train(data="coco8-multispectral.yaml", epochs=100, imgsz=640)
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # Train YOLO11n on COCO8-Multispectral using the command line
        yolo detect train data=coco8-multispectral.yaml model=yolo11n.pt epochs=100 imgsz=640
        ```

## Sample Images and Annotations

Below is an example of a mosaiced training batch from the COCO8-Multispectral dataset:

- **Mosaiced Image**: This image illustrates a training batch where multiple dataset images are combined using mosaic augmentation. Mosaic augmentation increases the diversity of objects and scenes within each batch, helping the model generalize better to various object sizes, aspect ratios, and backgrounds.

This technique is especially useful for small datasets like COCO8-Multispectral, as it maximizes the value of each image during training.
