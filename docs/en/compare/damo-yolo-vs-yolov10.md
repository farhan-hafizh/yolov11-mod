# DAMO-YOLO VS YOLOv10

The comparison between DAMO-YOLO and YOLOv10 highlights the evolution of real-time object detection models and their impact on computer vision applications. Both models bring unique advancements to the table, offering insights into balancing accuracy, computational efficiency, and deployment versatility.

DAMO-YOLO is recognized for its innovative approaches in lightweight design and efficient feature extraction, making it ideal for constrained environments. On the other hand, YOLOv10, built on the Ultralytics framework, delivers state-of-the-art performance by eliminating the need for non-maximum suppression (NMS) during inference, as detailed in [YOLOv10 documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov10/).

## mAP Comparison

This section compares DAMO-YOLO and YOLOv10 models based on their mAP values, a key metric for evaluating object detection accuracy. Mean Average Precision (mAP) reflects a model's ability to balance precision and recall across various thresholds.

## YOLO11 Functionalities: Predict

The Predict functionality in Ultralytics YOLO11 empowers users to make accurate inferences on new images, videos, or datasets with minimal effort. Designed with simplicity and efficiency, YOLO11â€™s prediction capabilities support a wide range of applications, including object detection, segmentation, pose estimation, and classification. Whether you're working on real-time video feeds or static imagery, YOLO11 ensures high-speed and reliable outputs.

With its seamless integration in the Ultralytics Python package, users can quickly implement predictions using a few lines of code. For more details and best practices, explore the [YOLO11 Predict Guide](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/predict/).

### Example Code for Making Predictions

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a pre-trained YOLO11 model
model = YOLO("yolo11.pt")

# Run predictions on an image
results = model.predict(source="image.jpg", save=True)

# Display results
results.show()
```
