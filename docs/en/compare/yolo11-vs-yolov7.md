## Fine-Tuning With Car Parts Segmentation

Ultralytics YOLO11 allows custom fine-tuning on specific datasets, such as Car Parts Segmentation, to meet specialized project requirements. By leveraging labeled examples, YOLO11 can learn to identify and segment distinct car components, making it ideal for applications in automotive manufacturing, repair, or e-commerce cataloging. This capability ensures precision and relevance, outperforming generic pre-trained models in specialized tasks.

For more details, explore the [Car Parts Segmentation Dataset Guide](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/segment/carparts-seg/).

### Python Code Snippet for Fine-Tuning

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a pre-trained YOLO11 model
model = YOLO("yolov11.pt")

# Train the model on the Car Parts Segmentation dataset
model.train(data="carparts.yaml", epochs=50, imgsz=640)

# Validate the trained model
metrics = model.val()

# Save the fine-tuned model
model.save("carparts_model.pt")
```

This code demonstrates how to fine-tune YOLO11 for Car Parts Segmentation, ensuring optimal performance tailored to your dataset. Learn more about [custom training](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/train/).
